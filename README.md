### ABSTRACT
Approximate statistical inference via determination of the asymptotic distribution of statistics is routinely used for inference in applied medical statistics(e.g., risk ratio standard error). One method for variance estimation is the classical Delta method. But there is a gap as it is not routinely included in training for applied medical statistics and many researchers do not understand it or its uses. Given that a smooth function of an asymptotically normal estimator is also asymptotically normally distributed, the Delta method offers a formula to obtain the large-sample variance of a function of an estimator with known large-sample properties. In a more general setting, it is a technique for approximating the variance of a functional i.e., an estimand that takes a function as an input and applies another function to it (e.g.the expectation function). Therefore, we may approximate the distribution using the functional Delta method based on the influence function. The ongoing development of new methods and techniques may pose a challenge for applied statisticians who are interested in mastering the application of these methods. In this tutorial we introduce the use of the classical and functional Delta method and their links to the influence curve from a practical perspective. The code can be accessed at
